8. [Network File System](https://idcloudhost.com/kamus-hosting/nfs/)<br>
     NFS (Network File System) is a file sharing protocol over a network. NFS share files or resources over the network / network regardless of what operating system we use. Wow, are you curious to know more about NFS? This website will discuss about NFS and its disadvantages, advantages, and even the history of NFS. 

9. [Investigating Metadata](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/en/guides/behind-the-data-metadata-investigations/)<br>
     Metadata is structured data, marked with a code so that it can be processed by a computer, describing the characteristics of information-carrying units. This website will discuss how metadata is used to expose, protect and verify abuse and excesses of power. 

10. [Little and Big Endian Mystery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)<br>
     Little and big endian are two ways to store multibyte data types (int, float, etc). In little endian machines, the last byte of the binary representation of the multibyte data type is stored first. Whereas in big endian machines, the first byte of the binary representation of the multibyte data type is stored first. This website will discuss in depth about little endian and big endian and the mysteries between the two.
     
11. [The Role of Memory on The Computer](https://technick.net/guides/hardware/umg/01_002/)<br>
     Computers use Memory (RAM) to temporarily store instructions and data needed to complete tasks. This allows the computer's CPU to access instructions and data stored in memory very quickly. This website will discuss how memory acts as one of the most important indicators in a computer.
     
12. [Introduction to Memory Management](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/memory-management)<br>
     Main memory refers to the physical memory which is the internal memory to the computer. The computer can only change the data that is in main memory. Therefore, every program we run and every file we access must be copied from the storage device into main memory. On this website, we will learn about memory protection, memory allocation, fragmentation, and much more!

13. [Contiguous VS Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/difference-between-contiguous-and-noncontiguous-memory-allocation)<br>
     In the Operating System, there are two techniques for memory allocation, namely Contiguous Memory Allocation and Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation. In the tutorial on this website, we will learn what are the differences between the two memory allocations.
     
14. [Journey Across Static and Dynamic Libraries](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/journey-across-static-dynamic-libraries)<br>
     The nature of the library determines how the linker links to the final execution of a program. Compiled libraries have two forms, namely static libraries and dynamic libraries. Each format has advantages, disadvantages, and differs in how it is handled during the linking stage. This website will dig deeper into the meaning, journey, and differences between static libraries and dynamic libraries.
     
15. [Virtual Memory in Operating Systems](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/virtual-memory-in-operating-systems)<br>
    Virtual Memory is a technique that separates logical memory from physical memory. Logical memory is a collection of all pages of a program. Without virtual memory, logical memory will be directly brought to main memory. This website will discuss the benefits, needs, and how to execute programs in virtual memory.

16. [An introduction to virtual memory](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/introduction-virtual-memory)<br>
    Virtual memory is a technique that separates logical memory from physical memory. This website will discuss the explanation of virtual memory, the benefits of virtual memory, where all memory comes from, and how virtual memory is short

17. [Cache Memory in Computer Organization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-memory-in-computer-organization/)<br>
    Cache Memory is a small memory that is temporary. On this website will be discussed about the memory level, type, performance, and mapping of the cache.
    
18. [What is Memory Allocation in Operating System?](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)<br>
    Memory allocation is used to reserve a memory block of a specified size and returns a void pointer which is the memory address of the first memory block allocated which can be cast to another form pointer. This website will discuss an in-depth explanation of memory allocation, memory allocation types, and the advantages and disadvantages of each type.

19. [Difference between Concurrency and Parallelism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism/)<br>
    This website will discuss the difference between concurrency and parallelism. In addition, this website will also explain in more detail the meaning of these two things.
    
20. [Multitasking vs Multithreading](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-multitasking-and-multithreading-in-os.html) <br>
    Many people are still confused about the difference between multitasking and multithreading, this website will discuss in depth the differences between the two. We will discuss the differences between the various base comparisons so that we can understand better.
    
21. [How To Manage Processes from the Linux Terminal: 10 Commands You Need to Know](https://www.howtogeek.com/107217/how-to-manage-processes-from-the-linux-terminal-10-commands-you-need-to-know/)<br>
    The Linux terminal has a number of useful commands that can display running processes, stop them, and change their priority level. This website will tell you about classic and traditional commands, as well as some of the more useful, modern commands that make it easier for users.
    
22. [Process vs Thread: What’s the difference?](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)<br>
    This website will discuss the differences between processes and threads, which are still often confused by many people. Understanding, key differences, and properties will also be described in detail on this website.

    In Linux/Unix based Operating Systems, it is important to understand about fork and vfork system calls, how they behave, how we can use them and the differences between them. To understand this, this website will help us to find out in depth. This site will discuss what they are, fork, vfork, exec and wait system calls, their distinguishing characteristics and how they can be better used.
    
24. [Is Concurrency Really Increase the Performance?](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-concurrency-really-increases-the-performance-8cd06dd762f6)<br>
    If you want to improve the performance of your program, one possible solution is to add concurrent programming techniques. Basically, in concurrent execution, multiple threads of the same program are executed at the same time. This website will help you to understand further whether concurrency can really improve performance. Here, we will discuss the explanation of concurrency, various cases, problems, and serial programs related to performance increase.
    
23. [Semaphores in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
    Semaphore is a non-negative variable and is shared between threads. This variable is used to troubleshoot critical parts and to achieve process synchronization in a multiprocessing environment. This website will discuss the types of Semaphores, P and V operations, and points about P and V operations.

48. [How do hard drives work? - Kanawat Senanan (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wteUW2sL7bc) <br>
How do the hard drives in our computers work? How can it develop so fast that once a small disk board can only store a few megabytes, now there are those with the same size that can store a lot of data, up to TeraByte units. It turns out, the data is stored with electricity and heat, so basically we have to find a way to be able to store binary values in bits that we can later retrieve as information, besides storing, what is the idea so that we can also read them? ️

Drive Partition is basically dividing a drive into several volumes or logical drives, with different file systems. So basically we can create a container for our memory. Then there is also the partition scheme or MBR and GPT partition table. On the MBR, we can't make partitions more than 2 TB, but we really can't access more than that. The difference is also in the BIOS and UEFI, for more details, see the video

52.[Why you Shouldn't Low Level Format Your Hard Drive | Nostalgia Nerd (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RldQVSXdW0Y) <br>
In formatting there are usually two types, the meaning of low level and high level format now and then is different. Usually the Quick format basically just ignores the index table. If we do full formatting we will generally write the data blank completely empty it, and this is tantamount to rewriting it actually. But there is another term High Level and Low Level, at low level the point is to actually do the formatting manually and has entered the mechanical level, nowadays it is no longer possible. For more details, see the video. Because the point has to do with the division of hardware sectors on our disk drives.
